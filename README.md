# YaBOB - Yet Another BOB

> I grew sick and tired of all the bots that just doesn't quite do what I want. Every single bob had resource problems. 

> The YAEB efforts has been best and much of the work here will be based around YAEB.

> YaBOB will be an attempt to move away from Flex & Zinc.

**Note:** YaBOB is in very early development stages thus the core functions file wont be included as of yet.
